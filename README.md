I used Python and the CRISP-DM methodology to clean and analyze NYC bus breakdown data, identifying patterns in delays and failures to provide insights for reducing incidents.


Python Data Cleaning & Analysis of NYC Bus Breakdowns

In this project, I analyzed data from the Bus Breakdown and Delay System of New York City to identify patterns and causes of school bus failures. My goal was to provide recommendations to reduce breakdown incidents.

My workflow included:

    Reading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure.
    Cleaning the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
    Analyzing trends, such as:
        Identifying bus companies with the highest breakdowns.
        Determining the top reasons for delays.
        Examining the number of students affected by breakdowns.
        Calculating the average delay times based on reason types.

I followed the CRISP-DM methodology and used Python for data processing, ensuring a structured approach to extracting insights from the dataset.
